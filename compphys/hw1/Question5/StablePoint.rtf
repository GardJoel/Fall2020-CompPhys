\f0\fs24 \cf0 In the case of r=2.00 the system reaches its stable point fairly quickly and remains there (from the stable point solution its fixed point is at 0.5). In the case of r=2.99 the system is oscillating around its fixed point throughout the 50 iterations (from the stable point solution its fixed point is at ~0.666).}
